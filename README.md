# PDM Charlie
**PDM Charlie** is the working title for a game project by *Team C* of the university course "Produktion Digitaler Medien" at Hochschule Emden.  
  
Primary goal of the course is to create some type of digital media in the span of one semester. Each group can freely choose what kind of digital media they produce be it a shortfilm, a song or a videogame. We have decided to try our luck making a videogame in the vein of Super Smash Bros. by Nintendo/HAL Laboratory. Because of the limited time we have, we won't  be making a direct clone of Super Smash Bros. but rather a simplyfied version.  

___We are planning to include the following features:___
* Multiple characters with different abilities
* Multiple stages with different themes
* At least 2 gamemodes (Free for all & Teams)
* Customizable Gamerules
  * Number of Stocks
  * Time Limit
